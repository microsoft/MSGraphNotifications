This is used for making sure that what is loaded in the iframe (created by msal) does not have any side effects to the parent page (index.html)
As of msal-js 1.2.0-beta.0 (please see link above) the reply url can be an empty html page (thus, this page)
Besides that, all the js files that are loaded in the iframe are stopped from executing.
